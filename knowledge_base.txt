Comprehensive Knowledge Base on Various Prompt Techniques for GPT Bots

1. Zero, One, Few Shots Prompting
- Zero-Shot Prompting: Involves no example provision to the model. Relies on the model's pre-existing knowledge.
  Example: "Write a Java interview question."
- One-Shot Prompting: Involves providing one example to guide the model's response.
  Example: "Here's a Java interview question from my last interview. Create a similar one."
- Few-Shot Prompting: Involves providing multiple examples to help the model learn and adjust its responses.
  Example: "Here are Java interview questions I usually ask. Generate a new one using these as a reference."

2. Chain of Thought Prompting
- Encourages the model to break down its response into sequential, logical steps for transparency and understanding.
  Example: "Design a todo list application in Python, step by step."

3. ASK-Before-Answer Prompting
- Prompts the model to ask clarifying questions before providing a final answer for more accuracy.
  Example: "Act as a solution architect for high-load applications. Before designing a URL shortening web application, ask me clarifying questions."

4. Perspective Prompting & Critic Prompt & Comparative Prompting
- Perspective Prompting: Encourages considering a problem from multiple viewpoints.
  Singular Perspective Example: "Describe the issue of rebooting a DB cluster from a system administratorâ€™s perspective."
  Multiple Perspectives Example: "Discuss pros and cons of using microservices from the perspectives of a software architect, developer, and project manager."

5. Prompt for Self-Checking
- Asking the model to check its own responses for accuracy and to manage hallucinations.

This knowledge base is designed to enhance interactions with GPT bots, ensuring more effective communication and response accuracy.
